## Why Fork

This is a fork of the original anki addon with sole purpose to patch the "invisible" (i.e. color same as background) of code blocks **as they are
seen from `ankiweb.net`. Also I reduced the default code block text size from 125% to 100%.

## How to pack the addon and create a release
Create a zipfile of the `auto_markdown` folder with file extension `.ankiaddon`
